      <h2>Discovering Web Design and Starting a New Book</h2>
      <h4>June 3, 2024</h4>
      <p>I've made a routine of going to the coffee shop this summer right around noon every day. Today I was late; I stopped by Dickinson College's library to pick up a copy of <em>Herrndorf</em>, a biography of Wolfgang Herrndorf, author of <em>Tschick</em> and <em>Sand</em>. I'll be reading his bio this summer with Dickinson's Dr. McGaughey, a professor who I reached out to about a shared interest in Herrndorf's work.<br><br>I also decided rather impulsively to build this website. I've tried before, but it was much more amateurish and I was not very capable. I'll be working from the ground up with an HTML/CSS/JS stack, but I am honestly not entirely sure where the JS will come in with how static the website should be. Either way, I'm excited to get back into web design and see what I can get done before the end of summer. <br><br>Outlier work picked back up again today - I've been moved to a math project, which is a nice change of pace. Hoping to make some decent money for a trip to Berlin in August.</p>
