      Schlockfish is the biggest failure I've ever produced and it's not even close. This is no surprise; I knew I'd be building a disaster from the start. Schlockfish was built in a week with no outside help or research, mostly during my shifts as a cashier at Staples. The project was designed conceptually to exercise two things. Firstly, my ability to problem-solve and meet a deadline; I wanted to be under pressure and alone, way over my head in a topic filled with nuance and challenge. Second, I needed a way to play with and apply the data structures I'd learned about in the spring semester. I knew I'd never get a chess engine to beat me naturally, but I did build a chess engine. And it beat me if I let it.

      Schlockfish is built from nothing but pure Python. The engine is driven by a depth-first-search algorithm that ranks possible board states and makes a decision on the next move based on the results of optimal decisions from both sides. It operates now at a maximum depth of 3 - anything deeper never finished running on my machine. That is to say, if you can give the engine checkmate in 3, it'll win. If I had had it on hand, I would have let the program run and fill out best moves in a database on my Raspberry Pi to try to reach a higher depth. But I didn't, so enjoy the worst chess engine ever made in all its mistakes and failures.
